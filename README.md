# Forecasting Rainfall Using Ai

## Description
As the title suggests, this project aims to predict rainfall using Ai techniques. UK rainfall is used for the dataset.
Feature selection was optimized with the use of genetic algorithms (GA). Support Vector Regression is then used as the main technique for prediction.
A comparison between the results is done with and without feature selection to see how effective GAs are in this case.
The mean squared error (MSE) is used to gauge the results.
